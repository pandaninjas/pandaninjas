I'm @pandaninjas, admin at [@thefightagainstmalware](https://github.com/thefightagainstmalware/). I mainly do security and malware analysis, but I do all kinds of things, like [Raspberry Pi pytorch builds](https://github.com/pimachinelearning), [fast translation between DNS and DNS-over-HTTPS](https://github.com/pandaninjas/quic-dns), [silly utils I use myself](https://github.com/pandaninjas/Inflo), and [other things I find interesting](https://github.com/pandaninjas/llvm-ir)<br>
